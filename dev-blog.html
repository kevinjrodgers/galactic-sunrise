      <p>We at Star Fiend Studio are very excited to announce the official launch of our website!</p>
      <p>Many of our users and patreons have been excitedly asking for updates about Galactic Sunrise. We thought it would be a great idea to

        and updates for the game! 
      </p>

      <h1>Introducing Our First Game: Galactic Sunrise!</h1>
      <h4>August 16th, 2021</h4>
      <img src="images/galactic-sunrise.png">
      <p>As many of you know, we at Star Fiend Studio are working on a turn-based rpg called Galactic Sunrise. We thought it would be best to formally introduce it!</p>
      <p>Although it is very early in the works, it will be a sci-fi rpg heavily inspired by a game called Golden Sun back on the GameBoy Advance. Golden Sun has a soft spot
        in our hearts. We hope to capture that same sense of wonder and excitment in Galactic Sunrise that we had when playing Golden Sun. We truly hope that Galactic Sunrise
        will be an unforgettable experience for players that have never player Golden Sun and players that are die hard fans of the series!
      </p> 
      <p>We will be showcasing some of the concept art in the next update. We hope to see you then!</p>
